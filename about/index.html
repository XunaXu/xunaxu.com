    <h3 id="hi-there-thanks-for-taking-some-time-to-get-to-know-me">Hi There! Thanks for taking some time to get to know me.</h3>

<p>I am a programmer and enjoy writing code, but anything beyond that becomes a bit challenging and very time consuming, especially it comes to writing. However, I have always wanted to have my own blog site, so I have to try my best to come up something readable and useful.</p>

<h3 id="becoming-a-programmer">Becoming A Programmer</h3>

<p>Math was never hard for me, so its not a surprise that I enjoy programming. After one year of a commerce degree at the university, none of it made any sense to me. I always like visual arts, but I was hesitant to pursue it as a career, so I thought it would be good to combine the art and math together. A bachelor of computer graphics from the engineering department was on offer at that time. 75% programming and 25% design courses sounded great.</p>

<h3 id="javascript-yes">Javascript? Yes</h3>

<p>My first programming language was html, javascript and the web stuff in high school. Java was the major language taught at university, and I got to know algorithms and structures which I do like and is barely used now. After graduated from the university, I have become a front end software engineer and been using Javascript for past five years. The language itself has been transformed, and the community is really amazing.</p>

<h3 id="other-than-coding">Other Than Coding</h3>

<p>I like watching documentaries, sometimes read books. Since last year I have been spending a fair chunk of my time at the gym on chasing abs.</p>
